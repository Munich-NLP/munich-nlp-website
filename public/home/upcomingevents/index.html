<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>This paper presents a systematic overview and comparison of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods covering over 40 papers published between February 2019 and February 2023. These methods aim to resolve the infeasibility and impracticality of fine-tuning large language models by only training a small set of parameters. We provide a taxonomy that covers a broad range of methods and present a detailed method comparison with a specific focus on real-life efficiency and fine-tuning multibillion-scale language models.</p>

<h4 id="cutting-through-the-hype-jina-ais-scalable-open-source-solutions-for-multimodal-ai">Cutting Through the Hype: Jina AI&rsquo;s Scalable Open-Source Solutions for Multimodal AI</h4>
<p>In this talk, we will showcase how Jina AI helps organizations cut through the AI hype by providing practical and scalable AI solutions for industrial domains where stability, availability, and business value are crucial. You will learn how our open-source MLOps framework and multimodal products empower a seamless transition from research to industry-level applications across various sectors.</p>
<h4 id="longform-improve-instruction-tuning-with-corpus-examples-and-generated-instructions">LongForm: Improve instruction tuning with corpus examples and generated instructions.</h4>
<p>Instruction tuning enables language models to generalize more effectively and better follow user intent. However, obtaining instruction data can be costly and challenging. Prior works employ methods such as expensive human annotation, crowd-sourced datasets with alignment issues, or generating noisy examples via LLMs. We introduce the LongForm dataset, which is created by leveraging English corpus examples with augmented instructions. We select a diverse set of human-written documents from existing corpora such as C4 and Wikipedia and generate instructions for the given documents via LLMs. This approach provides a cheaper and cleaner instruction-tuning dataset and one suitable for long text generation. We finetune T5, OPT, and LLaMA models on our dataset and show that even smaller LongForm models have good generalization capabilities for text generation. Our models outperform 10x larger language models without instruction tuning on various tasks such as story/recipe generation and long-form question answering. Moreover, LongForm models outperform prior instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 and Alpaca by a large margin. Finally, our models can effectively follow and answer multilingual instructions; we demonstrate this for news generation.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) contributed to a major breakthrough in NLP, both in terms of understanding natural language queries, commands or questions; and in generating relevant, coherent, grammatical, human-like text. LLMs like ChatGPT became a product used by many, for getting advice, writing essays, troubleshooting and writing code, creative writing, and more. This calls for a reality check: which NLP tasks did LLMs solve? What are the remaining challenges, and which new opportunities did LLMs create?</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss several areas of NLP that can benefit from but are still challenging for LLMs: grounding, i.e. interpreting language based on non-linguistic context; reasoning; and real-world applications. Finally, I will argue that the standard benchmarking and evaluation techniques used in NLP need to drastically change in order to provide a more realistic picture of current capabilities.</p>
