<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) contributed to a major breakthrough in NLP, both in terms of understanding natural language queries, commands or questions; and in generating relevant, coherent, grammatical, human-like text. LLMs like ChatGPT became a product used by many, for getting advice, writing essays, troubleshooting and writing code, creative writing, and more. This calls for a reality check: which NLP tasks did LLMs solve? What are the remaining challenges, and which new opportunities did LLMs create?</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss several areas of NLP that can benefit from but are still challenging for LLMs: grounding, i.e. interpreting language based on non-linguistic context; reasoning; and real-world applications. Finally, I will argue that the standard benchmarking and evaluation techniques used in NLP need to drastically change in order to provide a more realistic picture of current capabilities.</p>

<h4 id="cutting-through-the-hype-jina-ais-scalable-open-source-solutions-for-multimodal-ai">Cutting Through the Hype: Jina AI&rsquo;s Scalable Open-Source Solutions for Multimodal AI</h4>
<p>In this talk, we will showcase how Jina AI helps organizations cut through the AI hype by providing practical and scalable AI solutions for industrial domains where stability, availability, and business value are crucial. You will learn how our open-source MLOps framework and multimodal products empower a seamless transition from research to industry-level applications across various sectors.</p>
<h4 id="longform-improve-instruction-tuning-with-corpus-examples-and-generated-instructions">LongForm: Improve instruction tuning with corpus examples and generated instructions.</h4>
<p>Instruction tuning enables language models to generalize more effectively and better follow user intent. However, obtaining instruction data can be costly and challenging. Prior works employ methods such as expensive human annotation, crowd-sourced datasets with alignment issues, or generating noisy examples via LLMs. We introduce the LongForm dataset, which is created by leveraging English corpus examples with augmented instructions. We select a diverse set of human-written documents from existing corpora such as C4 and Wikipedia and generate instructions for the given documents via LLMs. This approach provides a cheaper and cleaner instruction-tuning dataset and one suitable for long text generation. We finetune T5, OPT, and LLaMA models on our dataset and show that even smaller LongForm models have good generalization capabilities for text generation. Our models outperform 10x larger language models without instruction tuning on various tasks such as story/recipe generation and long-form question answering. Moreover, LongForm models outperform prior instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 and Alpaca by a large margin. Finally, our models can effectively follow and answer multilingual instructions; we demonstrate this for news generation.</p>

<p>This paper presents a systematic overview and comparison of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods covering over 40 papers published between February 2019 and February 2023. These methods aim to resolve the infeasibility and impracticality of fine-tuning large language models by only training a small set of parameters. We provide a taxonomy that covers a broad range of methods and present a detailed method comparison with a specific focus on real-life efficiency and fine-tuning multibillion-scale language models.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>I will talk about how in the social sciences (primarily political and communication science), neural NLP is being used
to measure constructs of interest that have previously been measured by hand coding.
I illustrate this with results from experiments on parliament speeches and party manifestos from the
last legislative period in Germany (2017-2021). One key issue I want to discuss (and where social science and computer science sometimes have a different understanding) is measurement validity.</p>

<p>What does robot judege/ Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) model actually predict from? I will talk about that neural LJP models without expert-informed adjustments can be vulnerable to shallow, distracting surface signals. Our experiments on neural LJP predicting European Court of Human Rights cases  shows adversarial training can help better align models with experts, and in many cases can even achieve better prediction performance.</p>

<p>Research on multi-class text classification of short texts mainly focuses on supervised (transfer) learning approaches, requiring a finite set of pre-defined classes which is constant over time. This talk covers deep constrained clustering (CC) as an alternative to supervised learning approaches in a setting with a dynamically changing number of classes, a task we introduce as dynamic topic discovery (DTD).

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Presenting and communicating the outcomes of your analysis has never been more engaging. Say goodbye to dull slides and hello to animated data storytelling.</p>
<p>In this talk, one of the creators of <a href="https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story">ipyvizzu-story</a> will demonstrate how this new open-source presentation tool, integrated with Jupyter Notebook and similar platforms, makes use of a simple Python interface to bring your data to life through animated stories.</p>
<p>We will delve into the syntax, logic, and evolution of ipyvizzu-story and the underlying chart morphing engine. By the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of when, why, and how to utilize this tool to its fullest potential.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petervidos"><strong>Peter Vidos</strong></a> Peter is the CEO &amp; Co-Founder of <a href="https://vizzuhq.com/">Vizzu</a>.</p>
<p>His primary focus is understanding how Vizzu&rsquo;s innovative approach to data visualization can be put to good use. Listening to people complaining about their current hurdles with building charts and presenting them is his main obsession, next to figuring out how to help data professionals utilize the power of animation in dataviz.</p>
<p>Peter has been involved with digital product development for over 15 years. Earlier products/projects he worked on cover mobile app testing, online analytics, data visualization, decision support, e-learning, educational administration &amp; social. Still, building a selfie teleport just for fun is what he likes to boast about when asked about previous experiences.</p>
