<p>We are back with our second collaborative event with PyData (Vol. 2)! The event will be held in-person at JetBrains Munich, where we will be providing drinks and pizza. Register for the event <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pydata-munchen/events/289404388/?_xtd=gqFyqTMyNjU0NTQxOKFwo2FwaQ%253D%253D&amp;from=ref">here</a>.</p>
<p>We have exciting talks from two amazing speakers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reproducible ML Workflows &amp; Dev Environments with dstack</strong> by <strong>Andrey Cheptsov, dstack</strong></p>
<p>Building ML models is an iterative process. Let’s talk about tools and practices that help set up your dev environments and workflows for better productivity and reproducibility?</p>
<p>As a bonus, we’ll have an overview of dstack, an open-source utility that simplifies the MLOps stack, and helps run ML workflows and dev environments in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>
<img src="/images/andrey-cheptsov.jpeg" alt="Andrey Cheptsov &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Cheptsov</strong> is the creator of dstack. He is passionate about open-source and developer tools for AI. Previously, Andrey worked at JetBrains with the PyCharm team.</p>

<p><strong>Why ML Should be Written as Pipelines from the Get-Go</strong> by <strong>Hamza Tahir, ZenML</strong></p>
<p>The mechanism through which ML propagates through an organisation from experimentation to production is key to its success. Oftentimes, there is a tendency to break this mechanism into a multi-step process, where experimentation workflows are siloed from their production counter-parts. This &ldquo;Throw it over the wall&rdquo; anti-pattern can stunt the velocity of ML teams. In this talk, we talk about why teams should unify this multi-stage process, and give data scientists more agency to exercise control over their production workflows. We&rsquo;ll also go through a practical demonstration with creating a unified MLOps pipeline with ZenML.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>
<img src="/images/hamza-tahir.jpg" alt="Hamza Tahir &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><strong>Hamza Tahir</strong> is a software developer turned ML engineer. An indie hacker by heart, he loves ideating, implementing, and launching data-driven products. His previous projects include PicHance, Scrilys, BudgetML, and you-tldr. Based on his learnings from deploying ML in production for predictive maintenance use-cases in his previous startup, he co-created ZenML, an open-source MLOps framework to build portable production-ready ML pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Key technologies, like e.g. NLP, crucially depend on well-educated people to conduct sound and innovative research. While the quality and the availability of teaching resources plays a central role here, it is still not super common to (collaboratively) create and share them across institutions. In this talk, I will cover three main aspects:
First, the development of open source educational resources (OSER) within the scope of the i2ml lecture at the SLDS chair (LMU Munich) will be showcased. Second, I will cover the latest developments in NLP in order to show the necessity of creating high quality OSER for this field to equip undergrads / young researchers with the methodological background to eventually perform good research. Third, I will briefly introduce a joint project between two chairs from LMU (SLDS, CIS) and Ben Roth&rsquo;s chair (UNIVIE) with the goal to create OSER for NLP following the blueprint of i2ml.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this event</h3>
<p>Natural language processing (NLP) technology has seen tremendous improvements in recent years but most of these successes have been concentrated in languages with large amounts of data. In this talk, I will discuss challenges and potential solutions on the way to scaling NLP to more of the world&rsquo;s 7000 languages. In particular, I will highlight recent progress in NLP for African languages and present methods that are applicable to languages with limited data such as employing alternative sources of data and multi-modal information.</p>

<p>We have exciting talks from two amazing speakers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Practical Text Search or how to beat Elasticsearch (when you have to)</strong> by <strong>Egor Labintcev, Alyne GmbH</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, Egor is going to guide you through the process of building a good text search engine when it’s hard to do so. He’ll start by defining what actually makes the text search good (it’s not that trivial), continue with a colourful description of the struggle the speaker went through while building a (relatively) good text search, and culminate by stating the best practices and approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>
<img src="/images/egor-labintcev.jpg" alt="Egor Labintcev &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><strong>Egor Labintcev</strong> is currently a Senior ML Engineer in the RegTech industry. He builds various text engines ranging from low-resource extreme multi-label classification to ensemble-based text search in complex domains. His current research interest lies in modern retrieval approaches and NLP model interpretability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fraud Detection with Graph Features and GNN</strong> by <strong>Nikita Iserson, S&amp;P Global</strong></p>
<p>Identifying fraudulent behaviors is becoming increasingly more complex as technology advances and fraudsters constantly evolve new ways to exploit people, companies, and institutions. The complexity grows as companies introduce new channels, platforms, and devices for customers to engage with their brand, manage their accounts, and make transactions. Graph neural networks (GNN) are increasingly being used to identify suspicious behavior. GNNs can combine graph structures, such as email accounts, addresses, phone numbers, and purchasing behavior to find meaningful patterns and enhance fraud detection.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this event</h3>
<p>What if we did not use transformers? Can we still do NLP? Yes.</p>
<p>In this talk, Vincent will discuss some effective tricks in NLP that don&rsquo;t require a transformer or a GPU. It will be a collection of techniques that he has seen work in the field including some tricks with embeddings, annotation techniques, tf-idf, subword embeddings, and multi-word embeddings. Many of these techniques can also be used outside of the realm of NLP and most of the topics will be discussed via a live demo.</p>
<p>If there is time, Vincent might also show a very cool fine-tuning trick!</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this event</h3>
<p>Running ML workflows involves a lot of hurdles, especially if you don’t have a FAANG-level ML infrastructure. Classical MLOps platforms provide a certain level of automation but often require a complex setup and may stand in the way more than help. Particularly, if you want to run modular code (rather than spread it over a notebook), use Git, and your favourite code editor and terminal. Join this meet-up to learn more about the tool, and general best practices related to setting up your dev environment for ML.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this event</h3>
<p>Using deep neural networks to map text to dense vector spaces (also known as semantic search), has brought tremendous progress to textual information retrieval. However, recent research showed that this widely adopted approach is extremely sensitive to data drift and performs poorly on out-of-domain and long tail queries.</p>
<p>In this talk, Nils will give an introduction to the next generation of semantic search architectures. First, he will talk about hybrid continuous-binary approaches that can lead up to a 100 times cost reduction for deploying semantic search. Then, he will present learned sparse representations that perform a lot better in terms of data drift, out-of-domain and long tail queries. These approaches are especially suited in domains with quickly evolving information needs like news retrieval.</p>
