<p>We will talk about leveraging the power of pretrained transformer models by adjusting and fine-tuning to fit custom problems. We illustrate the flexibility by discussing diverse use cases that were part of recent kaggle competitions like question answering, sentiment segmentation, multilingual toxicity detection or ordering of the code cells in a jupyter notebook.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Whether you are a large corporation or a single person, getting started with machine learning is not easy, especially if you have little to no data. To overcome this cold-start problem, we would like to show you how to leverage state-of-the-art techniques to kickstart your next NLP project and get high-quality labels fast. We&rsquo;ll cover topics such as active learning, weak supervision as well as confident and zero-shot learning. Your hosts will be Moritz, Div, and Leo from the company Kern AI, who use these advanced techniques in their open-source data-centric IDE for NLP called “refinery”.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Since the first modern Neural Networks were designed in the 1980s, NLP and the Linguistic debate about the modelling of human language have mostly diverged. Nevertheless, they have interacted and shaped each other in important ways, e.g. in the discussion about whether SotA language models reach their performances the &lsquo;right‘ way. This talk will explore the development of NLP from the perspective of the Linguistic debate of rule-l vs. usage-based theories, and highlight why taking a stand in this debate is important for finding solutions to the challenges facing SotA LLMs.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this Event</h3>
<p>Many companies are already using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the decisive factors are not only to train the best fitting model but the time to value of the models is crucial. To improve the time to value consistently, an end-to-end MLOps process that is required to train, test, deploy, run, and monitor ML models is essential for a company&rsquo;s success. This pipeline also should consider governance and security aspects. Building such a MLOps pipeline is a complex journey as the process consists of integration and choosing many different tools of a machine learning live cycle. It also requires the expertise of a combination of different stakeholder such as DevOps, Data Engineering and Data Science. This talk gives an insight of lessons learned by industry projects to efficiently setting up a complete ML and AI end-to-end pipeline to provide and maintain fast and accurate predictions.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-event">About this event</h3>
<p>We would like to invite you to the 11th NLP meetup with two very interesting talks and a great Xmas special surprise 😊 Thanks to our host Munich Re, we will again meet at a very cool location in the middle of Munich. 🚀</p>
<p>In the first talk, we will learn about NLP activities @ Munich Re and what impact large language models (LLMs) could potentially have on use cases in the finance and insurance domain. The second talk discusses a very interesting study on sequential multi-task learning comparing training language models on a smaller set of related tasks vs. the large-scale multi-task training with potential to reduce computational resources and costs. So, let us getting inspired by great ideas and insights by these two talks 😊</p>
<p>Eventually, we want to thank Munich Re for hosting this evening and for organizing a very special Xmas surprise for our NLP community.</p>

<p>We are back with our second collaborative event with PyData (Vol. 2)! The event will be held in-person at JetBrains Munich, where we will be providing drinks and pizza. Register for the event <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pydata-munchen/events/289404388/?_xtd=gqFyqTMyNjU0NTQxOKFwo2FwaQ%253D%253D&amp;from=ref">here</a>.</p>
<p>We have exciting talks from two amazing speakers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reproducible ML Workflows &amp; Dev Environments with dstack</strong> by <strong>Andrey Cheptsov, dstack</strong></p>
<p>Building ML models is an iterative process. Let’s talk about tools and practices that help set up your dev environments and workflows for better productivity and reproducibility?</p>
<p>As a bonus, we’ll have an overview of dstack, an open-source utility that simplifies the MLOps stack, and helps run ML workflows and dev environments in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>
<img src="/images/andrey-cheptsov.jpeg" alt="Andrey Cheptsov &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><strong>Andrey Cheptsov</strong> is the creator of dstack. He is passionate about open-source and developer tools for AI. Previously, Andrey worked at JetBrains with the PyCharm team.</p>

<p><strong>Why ML Should be Written as Pipelines from the Get-Go</strong> by <strong>Hamza Tahir, ZenML</strong></p>
<p>The mechanism through which ML propagates through an organisation from experimentation to production is key to its success. Oftentimes, there is a tendency to break this mechanism into a multi-step process, where experimentation workflows are siloed from their production counter-parts. This &ldquo;Throw it over the wall&rdquo; anti-pattern can stunt the velocity of ML teams. In this talk, we talk about why teams should unify this multi-stage process, and give data scientists more agency to exercise control over their production workflows. We&rsquo;ll also go through a practical demonstration with creating a unified MLOps pipeline with ZenML.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>
<img src="/images/hamza-tahir.jpg" alt="Hamza Tahir &gt;&lt;"></p>
<p><strong>Hamza Tahir</strong> is a software developer turned ML engineer. An indie hacker by heart, he loves ideating, implementing, and launching data-driven products. His previous projects include PicHance, Scrilys, BudgetML, and you-tldr. Based on his learnings from deploying ML in production for predictive maintenance use-cases in his previous startup, he co-created ZenML, an open-source MLOps framework to build portable production-ready ML pipelines.</p>
