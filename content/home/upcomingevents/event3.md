### About this Event

Presenting and communicating the outcomes of your analysis has never been more engaging. Say goodbye to dull slides and hello to animated data storytelling.

In this talk, one of the creators of [ipyvizzu-story](https://github.com/vizzuhq/ipyvizzu-story) will demonstrate how this new open-source presentation tool, integrated with Jupyter Notebook and similar platforms, makes use of a simple Python interface to bring your data to life through animated stories.

We will delve into the syntax, logic, and evolution of ipyvizzu-story and the underlying chart morphing engine. By the end of the session, you will have a clear understanding of when, why, and how to utilize this tool to its fullest potential.
