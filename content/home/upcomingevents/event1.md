### Speaker

![Chris Emezue ><](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEBCaYpwagcWQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1588976757668?e=1700697600&v=beta&t=SOWkuwHDxhrKPJZB_4tMEy6zR3_Cwgv2e10UoZwaG2Y)

[**Chris Emezue**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisemezue/) is a seasoned researcher committed to developing intelligent systems that can learn even in low-resource scenarios, and are reliable. His research areas are natural language processing, causality, and reinforcement learning. As a dedicated contributor to the field of AfricaNLP, he has worked on several key projects to improve the representation of low-resource African language technologies and datasets. Furthermore, as an entrepreneur, Chris is building Lanfrica, a startup that aims to accelerate the development of AI applications in under-represented regions.

![Oliver Pfaffel ><](/images/oliver-pfaffel.jpg) 

[**Dr. Oliver Pfaffel**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-pfaffel/)has been working as a data scientist / NLP engineer in insurance for more than a decade. He holds a PhD in mathematical statistics (TUM, Columbia, NUS) and regularly lectures at the European Actuarial Academy and TUM. In this introductory talk, we delve into various strategies employed for question answering tailored specifically to the field of network engineering. We will cover generative solutions using large language models as well as retrieval-based techniques, which we will demonstrate using a sample StackExchange dataset. Considerations will be given to the use of private or confidential data. We will critically analyze different evaluation types, elaborating on their respective advantages and limitations. It is important to note that this presentation is grounded in a personal project and holds no affiliation to any professional activity or company.
