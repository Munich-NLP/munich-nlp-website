### About this event

We would like to invite you to the 11th NLP meetup with two very interesting talks and a great Xmas special surprise ðŸ˜Š Thanks to our host Munich Re, we will again meet at a very cool location in the middle of Munich. ðŸš€

In the first talk, we will learn about NLP activities @ Munich Re and what impact large language models (LLMs) could potentially have on use cases in the finance and insurance domain. The second talk discusses a very interesting study on sequential multi-task learning comparing training language models on a smaller set of related tasks vs. the large-scale multi-task training with potential to reduce computational resources and costs. So, let us getting inspired by great ideas and insights by these two talks ðŸ˜Š

Eventually, we want to thank Munich Re for hosting this evening and for organizing a very special Xmas surprise for our NLP community.
