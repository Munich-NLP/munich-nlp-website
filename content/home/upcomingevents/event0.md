We have exciting talks from two amazing speakers:

1. **Practical Text Search or how to beat Elasticsearch (when you have to)** by **Egor Labintcev, Alyne GmbH**

   In this talk, Egor is going to guide you through the process of building a good text search engine when it’s hard to do so. He’ll start by defining what actually makes the text search good (it’s not that trivial), continue with a colourful description of the struggle the speaker went through while building a (relatively) good text search, and culminate by stating the best practices and approaches.

   **Speaker**

   **Egor Labintcev** is currently a Senior ML Engineer in the RegTech industry. He builds various text engines ranging from low-resource extreme multi-label classification to ensemble-based text search in complex domains. His current research interest lies in modern retrieval approaches and NLP model interpretability.

2. **Bot Detection in the Wild** by **Réne Brunner, Datamics GmbH**

   More info coming soon.
