### About this Event

Many companies are already using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the decisive factors are not only to train the best fitting model but the time to value of the models is crucial. To improve the time to value consistently, an end-to-end MLOps process that is required to train, test, deploy, run, and monitor ML models is essential for a company's success. This pipeline also should consider governance and security aspects. Building such a MLOps pipeline is a complex journey as the process consists of integration and choosing many different tools of a machine learning live cycle. It also requires the expertise of a combination of different stakeholder such as DevOps, Data Engineering and Data Science. This talk gives an insight of lessons learned by industry projects to efficiently setting up a complete ML and AI end-to-end pipeline to provide and maintain fast and accurate predictions.
