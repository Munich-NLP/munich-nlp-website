### About this Event

What does robot judege/ Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) model actually predict from? I will talk about that neural LJP models without expert-informed adjustments can be vulnerable to shallow, distracting surface signals. Our experiments on neural LJP predicting European Court of Human Rights cases  shows adversarial training can help better align models with experts, and in many cases can even achieve better prediction performance.
