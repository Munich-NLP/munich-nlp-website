### About this Event

Whether you are a large corporation or a single person, getting started with machine learning is not easy, especially if you have little to no data. To overcome this cold-start problem, we would like to show you how to leverage state-of-the-art techniques to kickstart your next NLP project and get high-quality labels fast. We'll cover topics such as active learning, weak supervision as well as confident and zero-shot learning. Your hosts will be Moritz, Div, and Leo from the company Kern AI, who use these advanced techniques in their open-source data-centric IDE for NLP called “refinery”.
