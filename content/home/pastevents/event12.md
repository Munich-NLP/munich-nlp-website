### About this Event

Key technologies, like e.g. NLP, crucially depend on well-educated people to conduct sound and innovative research. While the quality and the availability of teaching resources plays a central role here, it is still not super common to (collaboratively) create and share them across institutions. In this talk, I will cover three main aspects:
First, the development of open source educational resources (OSER) within the scope of the i2ml lecture at the SLDS chair (LMU Munich) will be showcased. Second, I will cover the latest developments in NLP in order to show the necessity of creating high quality OSER for this field to equip undergrads / young researchers with the methodological background to eventually perform good research. Third, I will briefly introduce a joint project between two chairs from LMU (SLDS, CIS) and Ben Roth's chair (UNIVIE) with the goal to create OSER for NLP following the blueprint of i2ml.

He obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Economics from LMU in 2014, afterwards he turned to Statistics (with a focus on social and economic studies) and obtained his Master’s degree in 2017 (also from LMU). In October 2021, he finished his PhD at the working group Methods for Missing Data, Model Selection and Model Averaging under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Christian Heumann with a focus on Natural Language Processing. Further, he is one of the co-founders of the [Open Science Initiative in Statistics (OSIS)](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/institut/osis/index.html).
