### About this Event

Since the first modern Neural Networks were designed in the 1980s, NLP and the Linguistic debate about the modelling of human language have mostly diverged. Nevertheless, they have interacted and shaped each other in important ways, e.g. in the discussion about whether SotA language models reach their performances the 'rightâ€˜ way. This talk will explore the development of NLP from the perspective of the Linguistic debate of rule-l vs. usage-based theories, and highlight why taking a stand in this debate is important for finding solutions to the challenges facing SotA LLMs.

[**Leonie Weissweiler**](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~weissweiler/) is a PhD student at CIS LMU, supervised by Prof. SchÃ¼tze. She is interested in leveraging methods from NLP to contribute to the empirical study of the emergent structure of Language, its evolution and processing in the brain. Her current research focuses on multilingual unsupervised Morphosyntax and probing language models for Construction Grammar together with Carnegie Mellon University.
