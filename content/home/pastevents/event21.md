### About this Event

We will talk about leveraging the power of pretrained transformer models by adjusting and fine-tuning to fit custom problems. We illustrate the flexibility by discussing diverse use cases that were part of recent kaggle competitions like question answering, sentiment segmentation, multilingual toxicity detection or ordering of the code cells in a jupyter notebook.
