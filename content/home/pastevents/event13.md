### About this event

We are back with our second collaborative event with PyData (Vol. 2)! The event will be held in-person at JetBrains Munich, where we will be providing drinks and pizza. Register for the event [here](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-munchen/events/289404388/?_xtd=gqFyqTMyNjU0NTQxOKFwo2FwaQ%253D%253D&from=ref).

We have exciting talks from two amazing speakers:

1. **Reproducible ML Workflows & Dev Environments with dstack** by **Andrey Cheptsov, dstack**

    Building ML models is an iterative process. Let’s talk about tools and practices that help set up your dev environments and workflows for better productivity and reproducibility?
    
    As a bonus, we’ll have an overview of dstack, an open-source utility that simplifies the MLOps stack, and helps run ML workflows and dev environments in the cloud.

    **Andrey Cheptsov** is the creator of dstack. He is passionate about open-source and developer tools for AI. Previously, Andrey worked at JetBrains with the PyCharm team.

2. **Why ML Should be Written as Pipelines from the Get-Go** by **Hamza Tahir, ZenML**

    The mechanism through which ML propagates through an organisation from experimentation to production is key to its success. Oftentimes, there is a tendency to break this mechanism into a multi-step process, where experimentation workflows are siloed from their production counter-parts. This "Throw it over the wall" anti-pattern can stunt the velocity of ML teams. In this talk, we talk about why teams should unify this multi-stage process, and give data scientists more agency to exercise control over their production workflows. We'll also go through a practical demonstration with creating a unified MLOps pipeline with ZenML.

    ![Hamza Tahir ><](/images/hamza-tahir.jpg)

    **Hamza Tahir** is a software developer turned ML engineer. An indie hacker by heart, he loves ideating, implementing, and launching data-driven products. His previous projects include PicHance, Scrilys, BudgetML, and you-tldr. Based on his learnings from deploying ML in production for predictive maintenance use-cases in his previous startup, he co-created ZenML, an open-source MLOps framework to build portable production-ready ML pipelines.
