### About this event

We will take a dive into the field of evaluation of generated text where Philipp Koch will present his paper "Pre-trained language models evaluating themselves - A comparative study" (https://aclanthology.org/2022.insights-1.25/), which was recently accepted to the Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP @ACL'22.

Evaluation of generated text remains a significant issue. Recently introduced model-based metrics have shown promising results compared to n-gram-based metrics like BLEU, yet they still suffer severe drawbacks.
