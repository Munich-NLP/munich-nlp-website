### About this Event
We present our January Meetup in collaboration with Le Wagon at their Munich offices

#### Improving Image Captioning Through Clustering Approaches
Image clustering divides a collection of images into “meaningful groups”, typically interpreted post-hoc via human-given annotations. Those are usually in the form of text, begging the question of using text as an abstraction for image clustering. In this work, we introduce Text-Guided Image Clustering, where we generate text using image-to-text models and subsequently explore the use of generated text for clustering and cluster explainability.


#### LLMs to Business
We discuss how GenAI models are being used on a large scale in real production scenarios at major corporations. We demonstrate how challenges within companies can be addressed using GenAI, ranging from customer feedback analysis to smart entity extraction.

The talk is provided by CONVALID Analytics, the data and AI subsidiary of SMP Strategy Consulting. CONVALID Analytics consults large mid-sized and DAX-listed companies in the field of advanced analytics and generative AI. In doing so, CONVALID Analytics leverages research findings and implements them directly in companies to create real business value.
