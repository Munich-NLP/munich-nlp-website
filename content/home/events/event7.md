### About this event

Running ML workflows involves a lot of hurdles, especially if you donâ€™t have a FAANG-level ML infrastructure. Classical MLOps platforms provide a certain level of automation but often require a complex setup and may stand in the way more than help. Particularly, if you want to run modular code (rather than spread it over a notebook), use Git, and your favourite code editor and terminal. Join this meet-up to learn more about the tool, and general best practices related to setting up your dev environment for ML.
