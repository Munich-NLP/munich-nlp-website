MunichðŸ¥¨NLP is a community newly founded in May 2022 by LMU and TUM students focusing on NLP topics. Our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BgFaZgZ38N) community has already grown to over 700 members consisting not only of students, but also professors, and industry practitioners. We try host weekly workshops and/or paper-reading events, both to learn from guests and to gather inspiration for our own (research) projects, as well as to establish and keep going an active student NLP community in the Munich area. The goal is to promote NLP-related exchange between students, researchers, and practitioners inside and outside the university and to showcase paths and possibilities during and after university.
