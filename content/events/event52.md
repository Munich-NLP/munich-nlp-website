    Title of the talk : Bavarian NLP: How (and why) to process dialect data
 
    Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) has improved by leaps and bounds when it comes to processing data from standardized languages with plenty of available data, like German. However, NLP lags behind when closely related non-standard varieties are concerned, such as Bavarian dialects. I will give a brief overview of some of the challenges we face in dialect NLP: To start with, there is a general lack of high-quality data. On the technical side, subword tokenization methods sometimes struggle with ad-hoc pronunciation spellings, and evaluation metrics do not necessarily take into account linguistic variation. Furthermore, I argue that we should not only consider how to tackle dialectal variation in NLP, but also why, as the technology needs of dialect speakers can be different from those of standard language speakers. 

- 6:45 to 7:15pm Jenya Sukhodolskaya, Developer Advocate, Qdrant 
    Title of the talk: miniCOIL: Sparse Neural Retrieval Done Right 
 
    Abstract: Iâ€™ll present miniCOIL, an attempt to make a sparse neural retriever as it should be: a lightweight exact matches-based retrieval model with semantical understanding, that is performant on out-of-domain data.

- 7:15pm: Networking with Food and Drinks

[**Verena Blaschke**](https://verenablaschke.github.io/) is a PhD student at the MaiNLP research group (LMU Munich), supervised by Barbara Plank and co-supervised by Hinrich SchÃ¼tze. Her research currently focuses on NLP for dialects and low-resource language varieties.

Previously, she completed a Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degree in computational linguistics at the University of TÃ¼bingen, where she was also part of Johannes Dellertâ€™s team developing software for machine-assisted historical linguistics. She has also completed an internship in Appleâ€™s ML research group, working on crosslingual NLP.
