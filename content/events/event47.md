### About this Event

In this talk, Marat Saidov will discuss the advances in building efficient on-device language models optimized for NPUs, highlighting techniques such as memory-mapped embeddings, KV caching, 4-bit quantization and speculative decoding. A key focus is Rewrite, Microsoft's publicly available paraphrasing skill, covering comprehensive data collection strategies, carefully designed evaluation metrics utilizing LLM-as-a-judge, and various adapters such as LoRA. He will also highlight the role of system prompts and soft prompts, highlighting their effectiveness and competitiveness compared to LoRA. He will share insights on deploying compact models at scale, practical lessons learned, and future challenges we face.
