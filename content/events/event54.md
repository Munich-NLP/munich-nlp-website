### Agenda
**From Scratch to Production: LLM-Based E2E Service in Swiss Banking**  
Speakers: Jakob Klement, David Satomi, Fabian Stermann  
Handling over 60k customer interactions weekly across four languages while meeting strict regulations. A deep dive into building and shipping an end-to-end LLM voice/chatbot that replaced a legacy IVR at a Swiss bank, tackling technical and regulatory hurdles and raising first-solution rates from ~40% to 85%+.

**Beyond Retrieval: The Technical Core of Reliable Agent Reasoning**  
Speaker: Ludovic Tessier  
Why retrieval alone is solved—and what’s required for reliable agent reasoning: core components for analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating, and acting on retrieved data.

### Networking
